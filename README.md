# ExNavigator

ExNavigator is a scene navigator that is centered around routes and is built on top of React Native's Navigator. You define ExRoutes, which are plain JavaScript objects with functions to render the scene for the route and the components to display in the nav bar.

The API is in ExRoute.js and ExRouteRenderer.js.

Otherwise ExNavigator is very similar to Navigator.

## Important

This project probably won't work for you. You need ES6 and ES7 syntax and runtime options enabled as well as some other API shims and maybe a patched version of React Native.
